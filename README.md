An GraphQL analyzer to reject anonymous operation.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'graphql-anonymous_operation_rejector', require: 'graphql/anonymous_operation_rejector'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install graphql-anonymous_operation_rejector

## Usage

```rb
class MySchema < GraphQL::Schema
  query_analyzer GraphQL::AnonymousOperationRejector.new
  query Types::Query
end
```

Now `MySchema` accepts GraphQL queries with operation name only:

```rb
MySchema.execute('query { hello }').to_h
#=> { "error": [{ "message" => "Anonymous operation is not allowed. Please add operation name to your query." }]}

MySchema.execute('query thisIsOperationName { hello }').to_h
#=> { "data": { "hello" => "world" } }
```
